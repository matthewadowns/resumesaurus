## Welcome to my resume and blog

My name is Matthew Downs, and I am a technology professional with over 16 years experience as a Product Manager, Fullstack Software Engineer, and Professional Services Engineer.

At my home in Cloverdale, CA I tend an eco-centric food garden centered around native plants and pollinator-friendly perennials.  I consider myself a Permaculture practitioner, and I received a Permaculture Design Certificate from the Urban Permaculture Institute in San Francisco.
