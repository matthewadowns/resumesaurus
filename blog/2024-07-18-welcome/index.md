## Hello, and Welcome :wave:

My name is Matthew Downs, and I am a technology professional with over 16 years experience as a Product Manager, Professional Services Consultant, Technical Writer, Full-stack Software Developer.

After wonderful 12 years living in San Francisco, CA, I now call Cloverdale, CA home.

Stemming from my love of nature, I enjoy to growing vegetables, fruits, and flowers, and I make beautiful compost.  I tend a home-scale eco-centric food garden centered around native plants and pollinator-friendly perennials. I also enjoy playing music with friends, camping, fishing, SCUBA diving, and experiencing a myriad of cultures and arts.

Aside from this short intro, I plan to use this blog section to explain how I built and deployed this site, and from time-to-time share little things I pick-up along my personal and professional journey.

Thanks for visiting!  As always, I'm grateful for any [feedback](https://www.admonymous.co/matthewadowns).
